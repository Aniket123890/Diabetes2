The metabolic disorder known as hyperglycemia, which arises from insufficient insulin production or responsiveness, is a
defining characteristic of diabetes mellitus. The consequences of diabetes can be fatal if not promptly identified or treated, as vital
organs such as the heart, kidneys, eyes, nerves, and blood vessels are placed at risk. Over the years, computational diagnosis of
diabetes has explored the potential of machine learning as a means of predicting the disease. However, the current level of accuracy
achieved thus far suggests the need for further advancement. The objective of this study was to implement machine learning
algorithms and assess their respective accuracies, incorporating AdaBoost and gradient boost ensemble methods. In this research, the
proposal is to employ machine learning techniques to predict and diagnose diabetes using a dataset obtained from the UCI Diabetes
dataset. As for future work in this field, the development of mobile applications that can connect to smartwatches and assess
parameters such as blood pressure and BMI to evaluate diabetic status could be considered.
